# 👋 Hi, I'm Michael McBride

### AI | ML Research Engineer & Founder

As an AI research engineer and founder, I build next-generation deep RL platforms at the intersection of cognitive augmentation, agentic decision systems, and plasma-control, research aware machine intelligence. I push the boundaries of agent intelligence while making advanced ML systems more efficient, interpretable, and scalable. Current milestones include working prototypes, IP, and ongoing pilot discussions with domain partners in finance and plasma physics research. I am also open to strategic partners, and additional lab collaborations with like-minded individuals that want to accelerate global deep-RL impact and translate research into deployed systems.
