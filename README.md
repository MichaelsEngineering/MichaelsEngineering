# 🚀 Hi, I'm Michael McBride

### AI | ML Research Engineer & Founder

As an AI research engineer and founder, I build next-generation deep RL platforms at the intersection of cognitive augmentation, agentic decision systems, and plasma-control, research aware machine intelligence. I push the boundaries of agent intelligence while making advanced ML systems more efficient, interpretable, and scalable.
