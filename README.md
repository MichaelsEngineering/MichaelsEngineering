# üëã Hi, I'm Michael McBride

**Innovative ML Research Engineer** | Advancing AI through Deep Learning & Agent-Based Systems

With a strong foundation in AI/ML and over 9 years of experience, I specialize in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with deep learning and agent-based systems. My work involves developing novel algorithms and architectures, focusing on areas such as **Test-Time Training (TTT)**, **Program Synthesis with RL agents**, and **Neurally-Guided Program Induction**.

I thrive at the intersection of research and engineering, translating complex theories into practical, scalable solutions. My goal is to create AI systems that are intelligent, adaptable, and efficient.
